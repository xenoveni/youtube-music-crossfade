2. I can see the Player active and crossfade messages at the bottom, I like them. There are 2 messages at 
the bottom, can you change one of them to show the time until crossfade begins? With a text like "Crossfade 
in x seconds."
3. Add 2 more options. A button at the bottom, next to the informative texts to start crossfade now. Apply 
the crossfade function as soon as the button is pressed.
Second function, can you add an option in the crossfade settings to detect the wavelength of the music 
and apply the crossfade the x seconds I have chosen before the and of music, not before the end of the song. 
For example, some songs end and there is a large pause at the end. I want to avoid this and crossfade while 
music is still playing. Add this as a toggle in the settings for testing
